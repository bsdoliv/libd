libd
====

libd is an Unix-style oriented framework for writing of event-driven network
daemons/services in C++ focused on clear and comprehensible API. It provides a
high-level library of several Unix design patterns as found in high-performance
services such as varnish-cache[1], or relayd[5]. libd strongly relies on
libuv[2] as its event-machine core.

In the API level it is exposed a way to build C++ webservices with the same
look and feel of web.py[3], or TCP-servers with the same look and feel of
twisted[4], meanwhile under-the-hood, instead of "boostisms" and workarounds to
cope with cross-platform issues (windows), libd is implemented to take maximum
profit of resources broadly available at an underlying Unix-like operating
system.
