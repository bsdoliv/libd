libd
====

libd is an Unix-style oriented framework for writing of event-driven network
daemons/services in C++, focusing on clear and comprehensible API, which
strongly relies on libuv[1] in it's core.

In the API level, you'll find a way to build C++ webservices with the same look
and feel of web.py[2], or TCP-servers with the same look and feel of
twisted[3], meanwhile under-the-hood, instead of "boostisms" and workarounds to
cope with cross-platform issues (aka windows), libd is implemented to take
maximum profit of resources broadly available at an underlying Unix-like
operating system.
