libd
====

libd is an Unix-style oriented framework for writing of event-driven network
daemons/services in C++, focusing on clear and comprehensible API.

In the API level, you'll find a way to build C++ webservices with the same look
and feel of web.py[1], or TCP-servers with the same look and feel of
twisted[2]. But, in the under-the-hood instead of "boostisms" and workarounds
to cope with cross-platform issues (aka windows), libd implementation aims to
take maximum profit of resources broadly available at an underlying Unix-like
operating-system.

Installation
============

    % bmake -j 2
    % DESTDIR=/opt/libd bmake install
