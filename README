libd
====

libd is an Unix-style oriented framework for writing of event-driven network
daemons/services in C++ focused on clear and comprehensible API, but still fast.
It also provides a high-level library of several Unix design patterns as found 
in high-performance services such as varnish-cache[1]. libd strongly relies on
libuv[2] as its event-machine core.

In the API level, you'll find a way to build C++ webservices with the same look
and feel of web.py[3], or TCP-servers with the same look and feel of
twisted[4], meanwhile under-the-hood, instead of "boostisms" and workarounds to
cope with cross-platform issues (aka windows), libd is implemented to take
maximum profit of resources broadly available at an underlying Unix-like
operating system.
